          <p>Research on how to design the new site was conducted by asking the client a series of questions, of which the following are some examples:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>What are the business goals for the redesign? Are there any measurable indicators of success using analytics?</p></li>
            <li><p>How do you want to represent your brand online? What is the company's personality and how should that translate into Look & Feel?</p></li>
            <li><p>What are the products / services / company values that you want to make customers most aware of?</p></li>
            <li><p>What groups do the site’s users fall into and what are each of them looking for?</p></li>
            <li><p>Based on a provided list of existing model sites, what do you like/dislike about each of them?</p></li>
            <li><p>Are there internal technology platforms that you'd like to integrate with the site currently or in the future? Which browsers need to be supported?</p></li>
